## Weatherify

#### Introduction:
 Weatherify is a unique music recommendation platform that harnesses the power of weather data, time of day, and user preferences to curate personalized Spotify playlists. By integrating weather conditions, Circadian Rhythms, and music analysis, Weatherify offers users an immersive and mood-enhancing listening experience.

#### Key Features:
##### Weather-Based Playlists: 
Weatherify generates Spotify playlists based on real-time weather data from the user's location. Different weather conditions are associated with specific moods and music selections.
##### Circadian Rhythm Integration: 
Weatherify synchronizes music recommendations with the user's Circadian Rhythm, considering their natural energy levels throughout the day.
##### Mixing Taste Based On Recent Browse and Listening History.
##### Genre Based Filtering(more to come).

### How to use:
Since this project heavily reliase on Spotify Web API, right now the Spotify Web API plan of this project is still in `Development Mode` and because of this, access to this project is only after I put Spotify users name and email in Spotify Web API dashboard, so feel free to email me your Spotify accounts name and email at [yogeshsirsat56@gmail.com](mailto:yogeshsirsat56@gmail.com?subject=Access%20To%20Weatherify).
